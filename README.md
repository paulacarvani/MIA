# MIA - My First AI

***This project is for my Daughter, i hope she enjoys it as much as i do enjoy it doing it***

MIA is a web application developed using React on the frontend, Styled Components for styling, and Node.js on the backend. This application combines technologies such as Python and Mediapipe to provide text recognition capabilities and a rock-paper-scissors game using AI-based gestures.

## Features

+ Text Recognition: MIA utilizes Python and text recognition technologies to convert written text into speech. This allows users to type messages and listen to them as audio output.
+ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: MIA uses Mediapipe, a computer vision library by Google, along with Python, to enable users to play the classic rock-paper-scissors game using hand gestures. Gestures are captured through the webcam and processed using Mediapipe's AI capabilities.

## Technologies Used

+ **React:** A JavaScript framework used to develop the interactive user interface of MIA. React allows creating reusable components and maintaining an efficient application state.

+ **Styled Components:** A CSS-in-JS library used to style React components in MIA. Styled Components allows writing styles directly within React components, making it easy to maintain and reuse styles.

+ **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used on the backend of MIA. Node.js enables executing JavaScript code on the server, facilitating API development and handling client requests.

+ **Python:** A widely-used programming language in the field of AI and text processing. MIA utilizes Python to implement text recognition functions and the rock-paper-scissors game.

+ **Mediapipe:** A computer vision library developed by Google. MIA uses Mediapipe in combination with Python to capture hand gestures through the webcam and process them for the rock-paper-scissors game.

## Setup and Execution

1. Clone the MIA repository to your local machine.

'''
git clone git@github.com:paulacarvani/mia.git
'''

2. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

'''
